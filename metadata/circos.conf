# of first ideogram, transparency levels, output
# file and directory
#
# it is best to include these parameters from etc/image.conf
# and override any using param* syntax
#
# e.g.
# <image>
# <<include etc/image.conf>>
# radius* = 500
# </image>
<image>
<<include etc/image.conf>> # included from Circos distribution 
</image>

# RGB/HSV color definitions, color lists, location of fonts,
# fill patterns
<<include etc/colors_fonts_patterns.conf>> # included from Circos distribution

# debugging, I/O an dother system parameters
<<include etc/housekeeping.conf>> # included from Circos distribution

# <ticks> blocks to define ticks, tick labels and grids
#
# requires that chromosomes_units be defined
#
# <<include ticks.conf>>
